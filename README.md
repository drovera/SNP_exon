# A way to analyse GWAS data using exons

Genome Wide Association Studies allow to analyse the link between
frequency of single nucleotide polymorphism and phenotype by
comparing to a reference population.

The first step of this analyse is evaluating how the p-values of SNPs
resulting from comparison are transferred to genes.

Here method described in analyse_GWAS_by_exon.pdf is based 
on the base position of exons and the statistical relation
between positions of SNPs and positions of exons.

The manual to use Python scripts is SNP_exon_manual.pdf.
